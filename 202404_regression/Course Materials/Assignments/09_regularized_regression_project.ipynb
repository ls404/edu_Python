    "Build a Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet models that predict the `price` column in the dataset on San Francisco Apartment rentals. Make sure to go through all the the relevant steps of the modelling workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the model you built for the prior project as the basis for comparison. Does regularization improve fit?\n",
    "2. Feel free to skip the EDA and checking of assumptions again\n",
    "2. Engineer (or un-engineer previously) engineered Features as needed\n",
    "3. Fit a Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net Regression using the features in your original model.\n",
    "4. Once you are ready, fit your final model and report final model performance estimate by scoring on the test data. Report both test R-squared and MAE.\n",
    "5. What happens to your error if you only model apartments <= 6000 in price... should we do this?\n",

    "1. Remember, regularization doesn't always help, but it can, especially if you let it choose features for you!"
