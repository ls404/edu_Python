    "Build a linear regression model that predicts the `price` column in the dataset on San Francisco Apartment rentals. Make sure to go through all the the relevant steps of the modelling workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Cleaning has already been performed on this data\n",
    "2. Explore the data, keeping an eye on useful features and potential issues \n",
    "3. Choose a model validation scheme (simple or cross validation)\n",
    "4. Fit a Linear Regression Model\n",
    "5. Evaluate your model - check assumptions, metrics, and coefficient estimates\n",
    "6. Engineer Features as needed\n",
    "7. Repeat Steps 2, 4, 5, 6 as needed\n",
    "8. Once you are ready, fit your final model and report final model performance estimate by scoring on the test data. Report both test R-squared and MAE.\n",
    "\n",
    "A reasonable goal is to get a validation MAE of <= 500 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Perfect\" is the enemy of \"Good\".\n",
    "2. You will not get to an MAE of 0, we don't have perfect data, and there is some randomness and emotion in how things like apartment prices are set. \n",
    "3. Modelling is challenging, especially if you're new. There isn't a \"right\" answer, but some models are better than others. Remember - \"All Models are wrong, but some are useful\" \n",
    "4. We will likely end up with different models and performance metrics, and that's ok. You can always implement new ideas after watching the solution video. I didn't do anything too fancy, so you might think of some great ideas I didn't!\n",
    "5. Enjoy the process, and remember that at some point it's time to let the model go. No amount of feature engineering will achieve a perfect model."
