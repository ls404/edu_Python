### Prerequisites

Python (v3.5)

Spotipy (v2.4.4)

Sklearn (v0.18)


### Installing

Install Spotify's API spotipy as well as Sklearn.

### Gaining authorization to access Spotify's data

Spotify needs users to verify the application that will be used to access the data.

This can be done here: https://developer.spotify.com/. The application doesn't need
to be a complete/professional application, you just need to generate a client id and
secret client id when accessing spotipy via python.
